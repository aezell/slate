# Tracking an Order

Tracking orders is the best way to run an efficient and speedy kitchen.

Fresh KDS makes this easier than ever.

First, you'll want to authenticate:
<%= partial "partials/authentication.md.erb" %>

Next, we want to ensure we have the record for a order:
<%= partial "partials/get_an_order.md.erb" %>

We have some choices for our next steps:
- We could update the order
- We might want to cancel it
- We could report on its status

It's this last option that we'll do as part of our tracking setup.

Luckily, the status is already included in the data we returned.
